# Selenium Automation with Python and npm Packages

This repository contains a Python script (`main.py`) that automates browser actions using Selenium WebDriver. Additionally, npm packages can be installed for additional functionality or frontend testing. The configuration for the sites the script interacts with is stored in the `config.json` file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Chrome Browser
- ChromeDriver (for controlling Chrome via Selenium)
- Node.js and npm (optional, for additional JavaScript tools)

## Environment Setup

### 1. Install Python and Pip

Make sure Python 3.x and `pip` (Python's package installer) are installed on your machine. You can verify this by running the following commands:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
